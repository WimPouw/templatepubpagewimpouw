# Website Wim Pouw copy 1-12-2024
Here is a copy of Wim Pouw's pub page and the js and .css scripts needed. I put this online so people can borrow the website mechanics for their publication pages.

# Prerequisites
I learned to build my own website through this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5QFHp1oAws

# Quick overview
The publications html just has the frame of the page, containing proper linking to the assets/js/publist.js and the css styles (a main style from a template I use, and a specific pubsearch.css that I use for the easthethics of the publication cards.

# How to adjust my page
Super simple. You just change the themes list and the  "publication cards" in the js assets/js/publist.js. The cards are in const publications and the themes are in the "const themes".
